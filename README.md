# Nashpy: a python library for the computation of equilibria of 2 player strategic games.

This library implements the following algorithms for Nash equilibria on 2 player
games:

- Support enumeration
- Best response polytope vertex enumeration
- Lemke Howson algorithm

**Nashpy** has a simple set of Python dependencies: it only requires `numpy`
and `scipy` so is straightforward to install on all operating systems.

## Installation

**By design Nashpy** is easy to install: the easiest way to install is from
pypi:

```bash
$ pip install nashpy
```

## Usage

Create bi matrix games by passing two 2 dimensional arrays/lists:

```python
>>> import nashpy as nash
>>> A = [[1, 2], [3, 0]]
>>> B = [[0, 2], [3, 1]]
>>> game = nash.Game(A, B)
>>> for eq in game.support_enumeration():
...     print(eq)
(array([1., 0.]), array([0., 1.]))
(array([0., 1.]), array([1., 0.]))
(array([0.5, 0.5]), array([0.5, 0.5]))
>>> game[[0, 1], [1, 0]]
array([3, 3])

```

## Other game theoretic software

- [Gambit](http://www.gambit-project.org/) is a library with a python api and
  support for more algorithms and more than 2 player games.
- [Game theory explorer](http://gte.csc.liv.ac.uk/index/) a web interface to
  gambit useful for teaching.
- [Axelrod](http://axelrod.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) a research library aimed
  at the study of the Iterated Prisoners dilemma


## Development

To install a development version of this library:

```
$ python setup.py develop
```

To run the full test suite (install `pytest`: `pip install pytest`) and run:

```
$ pytest .
```

All contributions are welcome, although this is meant to be a simple library,
for more detailed game theoretic contribution please see
