Detection of type hints using mypy
====================================

Optional type hints can be added to python code which allows specification
of the type of a variable. Type hints were specified in 
`PEP484 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/>`. 

Type hints are ignored when running the code but can be statically analysed 
using a tool like `Mypy <https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction.html>`.
