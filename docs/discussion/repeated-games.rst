Motivating example: Repeated Coordination Game
----------------------------------------------

Consider the :ref:`Coordination game <motivating-example-coordination-game>` but
in this instance Alice and Bob repeat their play of this game. In other words,
they aim to meet (both making their decision at the same time) and after this
first meeting they repeat the process, with full knowledge of the outcome of the
first play.

This can be represented pictorially as follows:

To show this as an equivalent :ref:`extensive form game
<extensive-form-games-discussion>`, the tree is the same but we take care
to label the vertices correctly:

Using Nashpy

See :ref:`how-to-obtain-a-repeated-game` for guidance of how to use Nashpy to
use support enumeration to find Nash equilibria once a Normal Form game
representation has been obtained.
