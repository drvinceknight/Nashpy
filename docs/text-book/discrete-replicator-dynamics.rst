Discrete Replicator dynamics
===================
This is considered as the discrete version of the continuous :ref:`replicator-dynamics` and can be used to model how stratergies evolve over time
in systems that dont neccicarily change contiuously over time but rather in distinct increments.

how the hawk and dove game differs?

.. _an-explination-of-discrete_replicator_dynamics:
when the data your modelling comes in discrete time intervals use discrete replicator dynamics

when you want to model replicator dynamics on a finite population, use quantisation

Discussion
----------
1 - the function does not neccicarily converge to a point even where continuous replicator dynamics would and instead may oscillate

2 - the type 1 step function can produce negative values
