# Summary

Game theory is the study of strategic interactions where the outcomes of choice
depend on the choices of all participants. A key solution concept in the field
is that of Nash Equilibrium [@nash1950equilibrium]. This solution concept
corresponds to a coordinate at which no participant has any incentive to change
their choice.

As an example, consider the game of Rock Paper Scissors which can be represented
mathematically using the following matrix:

$$
A=
\begin{pmatrix}
0  & -1 & 1  \\
1  & 0  & -1 \\
-1 & 1  & 0  \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The rows and columns correspond to the actions available: Rock, Paper and
Scissors. A value of 1 indicates that that specific row beats the corresponding
column and similarly a value of -1 indicates a loss and a 0 indicates a tie. For
example \(A\_{21}\) shows that Paper (the second action) beats Rock (the first
action. Using `Nashpy` the equilibrium behaviour can be computed:

```
>>> import nashpy as nash
>>> import numpy as np
>>> A = np.array([[0, -1, 1], [1, 0, -1], [-1, 1, 0]])
>>> game = nash.Game(A)
>>> for eq in game.support_enumeration():
...     print(eq)
(array([ 0.33...,  0.33...,  0.33...]), array([ 0.33...,  0.33...,  0.33...]))

```

As expected: both players should play each action randomly (each with
probability 1/3).

Computing this equilibria for large games, situations where individuals have
many strategic options available to them requires the use of
software implementations of known algorithms.
A number of algorithms exist to compute these Nash equilibria, for example the
Lemke-Howson algorithm [@lemke1964equilibrium].

# Statement of need

Access to these algorithms is non trival, an example of this includes the
modelling of healthcare decisions [@knight2017measuring] where a bespoke
theoretic result was used to design a specific algorithm for the computation of
equilibria. Easily accessibly software would make that research more
straightforward as no new algorithm would need to be implemented.

The most mature piece of software available for the computation of equilibria
is **Gambit** [@mckelvey2006gambit]. Gambit includes a python wrapper to its
core C functionality however is not currently portable for example
Windows is not supported. There does exist a web interface with a Gambit back
end: [Game theory
explorer](http://gte.csc.liv.ac.uk/index/index.html#document-documentation)
however this is not practical for reproducible research.

``Nashpy`` is a Python library with all dependencies being part of the standard
scientific Python stack (numpy and scipy [@scipy]) thus it is portable. For
example Windows support is regularly tested through a Windows continuous
integration service (Appveyor).

``Nashpy``
currently implements 3 algorithms for the computation of equilibria (currently
only for 2 player games) and is extensively documented, including theoretic
reference material on the algorithms:
[nashpy.readthedocs.io](http://nashpy.readthedocs.io/). Furthermore, the
software is automatically tested using a combination of doc (this paper is also
tested), unit, integration and property based tests with 100% coverage.

There are potential limitations associated with Nashpy, these are due to the
complexity of the algorithms themselves. For example, support enumeration
enumerates all potential pairs of strategy. For $n\times n$ sized square
matrices it has complexity of the order of $\mathcal{O}\left({2^n}^2\right)$.
All implementations provided in Nashpy ensure these effects are reduced: numpy
[@scipy] provides C based implementations for vectorized performance.
Furthermore, all algorithms are generators which ensures that not all equilibria
must be found before one is returned. For example, below an 11 by 11 game is
considered and timings computed are shown for relative comparison.  Using the
more efficient Lemke-Howson algorithm [@lemke1964equilibrium] an equilibrium is
found approximately 3000 times faster.

```
>>> from pprint import pprint
>>> A = np.eye(11)
>>> game = nash.Game(A, A[::-1])
>>> pprint(next(game.support_enumeration()))  # 2.26 s ± 118 ms per loop
(array([ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  1.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.]),
 array([ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  1.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.]))
>>> pprint(next(game.lemke_howson_enumeration()))  # 734 µs ± 5.27 µs per loop
(array([ 0.5,  0. ,  0. ,  0. ,  0. ,  0. ,  0. ,  0. ,  0. ,  0. ,  0.5]),
 array([ 0.5,  0. ,  0. ,  0. ,  0. ,  0. ,  0. ,  0. ,  0. ,  0. ,  0.5]))

```

``Nashpy`` is designed to be used by researchers but also students in courses in
the fields of mathematics, computer science and/or economics. It is already
currently being used in a final year course at Cardiff University.  Due to the
fact that the code is written entirely in Python and is open source, this makes
it a positive teaching tool as students can read and understand implementation
of the algorithms.  ``Nashpy`` has been archived to Zenodo with the linked DOI:
