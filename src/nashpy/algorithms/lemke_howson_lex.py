    """
     Obtain the Nash equilibria using the Lemke Howson algorithm implemented
     using lexicographical integer pivoting. (Able to solve degenerate games)

     1. Start at the artificial equilibrium (which is fully labeled)
     2. Choose an initial label to drop and move in the polytope for which
        the vertex has that label to the edge that does not share that label.
    (This is implemented using integer pivoting and the choice of label
    to drop is implemented using lexicographical ordering)
     3. A label will now be duplicated in the other polytope, drop it in a
        similar way.
     4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until have Nash Equilibrium.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : array
        The row player payoff matrix
    B : array
        The column player payoff matrix
    initial_dropped_label: int
        The initial dropped label.

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple
        An equilibria
